  <h2>Commands</h2>
  <p>
    This home page is not only a page where you can search items. This is also
    the page where you can issue commands to the ZDragon backend system!
  </p>
  <p>You can use the following commands:</p>
  <div class="command-container">
    <div class="command">modules:</div>
    <span>This will search for all of the modules in the system.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="command-container">
    <div class="command">new: &lt;module name&gt;</div>
    <span>
      This will create a new module in the file system. You are free to choose
      your own name for the module. Spaces will be changed to dots and every
      word should start with a capital letter.
    </span>
  </div>

  <div class="command-container">
    <div class="command">&lt;text&gt;</div>
    <span>
      This will let you free format search for the data in the repository.
    </span>
  </div>

  <p>
    Yes, the ":" should be at the end of a command. The ":" makes a command a
    command! Commands can have terms behind them. For example, creating a new
    modules is:
  </p>
  <p class="command">new: &lt;module name&gt;</p>

</div>
