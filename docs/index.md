# ZDragon

So, you've come to understand the dragon? Software is a monster waiting to be tamed. It's a a
dragon. A Dragon which breathes fire, runs in circles and can defeat the best of knights; but don't
worry, ZDragon is here to help you out. With the help of this tool you will have your documentation
in order in no time.

## How to read this documentation

This documentation is written for people new to ZDragon. If you already know how to tame the dragon
you can skip these pages and just go to the downloads and language features.

For those of you who want to learn about ZDragon, these pages are for you! ZDragon is a
documentation language with some small features taken from real programming languages. Let me be
clear. ZDragon is _not_ a Turing complete programming language. Nor does it try to be one. ZDragon
lets you write down your thought and it will spit out models and diagrams.

## Roadmap

Architecture is a many faceted endeavor. The normal flow is based on a combination of describing the
processes, the data for the process, your logical data models and your application/infra
architectures. Currently ZDragon can only help with the modeling of the processes and the logical
data models.

On the current roadmap we have the following features:

- Application Architecture
- Information Architecture
- LaTeX support
- BPMN Diagrams
- Versioning
- Turing Completeness `\_('_')_/`
- Much, much more

When we look at the features it is safe to say that ZDragon has the very big goal of transforming
the way we write software. Let's make this dream a reality!
